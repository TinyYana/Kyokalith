# Kyokalith configuration reference

[繁體中文](CONFIG.zh-TW.md)

`plugins/Kyokalith/config.yml`. **There is no `/kyo reload`** — config is read once in `onEnable`; restart the server after changes.

Config validation is **fail-fast**: if any single ore definition is invalid (no material, `y_min > y_max`, `cell_chance` outside 0..1, an empty `ores:` block), **the plugin disables itself** rather than running with a broken config. If Kyokalith didn't enable, read the first line of the log.

## `config_schema_version`

| Key | Type | Current | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config_schema_version` | Int | `2` | Version of the YAML config shape. This is separate from the DB `schema_version` and `vein_algorithm_version` |

On startup, Kyokalith reads the version from the file itself with `contains(path, true)` **before** merging defaults. A missing key means v1.

This ordering matters for v1 → v2. Bukkit `copyDefaults(true)` otherwise inserts every bundled `y_weight_points` list into the old ore section while retaining that server's old `y_min`/`y_max`; the endpoints can disagree and fail-fast validation disables the plugin. For a detected v1 file, Kyokalith therefore:

1. merges ordinary new defaults;
2. replaces every inherited `ores.<type>.y_weight_points` with an empty list;
3. saves `config_schema_version: 2`;
4. logs `Legacy config detected...` and falls back to each ore's existing triangular `preferred_y` distribution.

This makes an in-place old-config startup safe, but it does **not** apply the new bundled calibration curves. To use those curves, install the complete v2 `config.yml` shipped in the release/patch; do not paste only `y_weight_points` into old ranges.

## `locale`

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `locale` | String | `zh_TW` | Language of admin-command output. Bundled: `en`, `zh_TW` |

Language files live in `plugins/Kyokalith/lang/<locale>.yml` and override the built-in text key-by-key — keys you delete fall back to the bundled defaults (and any key missing from a locale falls back to English). To add a language, copy `lang/en.yml` to `lang/<name>.yml`, translate the values, and set `locale: <name>`. Color codes use `&`; `{placeholders}` are filled in by the plugin.

---

## `database`

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `database.file` | String | `kyokalith.db` | SQLite file name, relative to `plugins/Kyokalith/` |
| `database.dirty_flush_interval_ticks` | Long | `40` | Interval for writing dirty positions back to the DB, in ticks (40 = 2 s) |

> 🔴 **`dirty_flush_interval_ticks` is a red line in both directions.**
>
> The write-back task runs on the **sync scheduler** (the global region scheduler on Folia); each flush opens a fresh JDBC connection per pending chunk and does `INSERT OR REPLACE` (no connection pool).
>
> - **Too small (e.g. `1`)**: you are now writing SQLite on a ticking thread every tick. Values below `1` are clamped to `1`.
> - **Too large**: more dirty positions are lost on a crash — and losing dirty flags **is a correctness/exploit problem**, not just data loss: blocks a player covered up become "first-exposure resolvable" again, reopening the cover-and-dig exploit.
>
> The default 40 is the balance point. Don't touch it unless you know what you're doing.

## `ores`

Data-driven. Adding an ore type, removing one, or changing depth distribution **requires no code changes**.

```yaml
ores:
  diamond:
    enabled: true
    materials:
      stone: DIAMOND_ORE
      deepslate: DEEPSLATE_DIAMOND_ORE
    dimension: NORMAL
    y_min: -63
    y_max: 16
    preferred_y: -59
    y_weight_points:
      - [-63, 1.0]
      - [16, 0.0]
    density: 1.0
    vein_size_min: 1
    vein_size_max: 4
    cell_chance: 0.06
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | Boolean | `true` | `false` = Kyokalith ignores this ore entirely: decoys stay vanilla, mining stays vanilla, no check events |
| `materials.stone` | Material | required (at least one) | Ore block to generate when the base block is `STONE` **or `NETHERRACK`** |
| `materials.deepslate` | Material | – | Ore block when the base is `DEEPSLATE`. **No fallback to `stone`** — unset means this ore never appears in deepslate layers |
| `dimension` | `NORMAL` / `NETHER` / `THE_END` | `NORMAL` | Only resolves in this dimension. **Nether ores must explicitly say `NETHER`** |
| `y_min` / `y_max` | Int | `0` | Hard range; outside it, never resolves |
| `preferred_y` | Int | `0` | Peak of the legacy triangular Y weight. Used only when `y_weight_points` is absent |
| `y_weight_points` | List of `[y, weight]` | – | Optional piecewise-linear Y curve. Points are sorted by Y; weights between points are interpolated and outside the first/last point use the endpoint weight |
| `density` | Double | `1.0` | Multiplier applied to `cell_chance` |
| `vein_size_min` / `vein_size_max` | Int 1–32 | `1` / `1` | Exact target block count of one deterministic, face-connected vein. Every `veinId` is strictly bounded by this value |
| `cell_chance` | Double 0.0–1.0 | required | Probability that an 8×8×8 cell spawns a vein origin (before `density` and the Y weight) |
| `priority` | Int | `0` | Atomic tie-break for overlapping shapes of different ores that support the queried base material: the lower-priority candidate is discarded in full; equal priority falls back to lower `veinId`. Surviving veins keep their full connected shape and exact size. Touching same-ore neighbors likewise suppress the higher stable `veinId`. Shown in `/kyo inspect` |

### Effective hit probability

```
activation = clamp(cell_chance × density × yWeight(y), 0, 1)
```

When `y_weight_points` is present, `yWeight` is the piecewise-linear curve described by those points. Otherwise Kyokalith retains the legacy triangular fallback: 1.0 at `preferred_y`, falling linearly to 0 at `y_min` / `y_max`.

### 🔴 Red lines

**`vein_size` controls yield per encounter, not encounter frequency.** It is an exact target count from 1 through 32, and the generated shape is deterministic and face-connected. Want players to meet veins more often? Calibrate `cell_chance`, `density`, and the Y curve while measuring total block density; do not inflate vein size.

**Do not copy a pre-1.3.3 `cell_chance` by itself.** One 16³ cell contains eight 8³ cells, so the number is not directly comparable. Treat the bundled 11-ore `cell_chance`, `vein_size`, and Y curves as one measured set; the regression suite guards tunnel spacing and 64³ total-volume ceilings together.

**Touching same-ore candidates do not merge.** Adjacent cells are checked deterministically; when their same-ore shapes touch, only the lower stable `veinId` survives. This is part of the generation contract, not a configurable probability.

**Cross-ore overlap never carves fragments.** Arbitration is candidate-atomic, not coordinate-by-coordinate: the losing vein disappears in full, while the winner remains face-connected at exactly its configured `vein_size`.

**Unset `dimension` = overworld only.** (An older config comment claimed "unset = matches all dimensions"; that was wrong — the code defaults to `NORMAL` and matches exactly.)

**`cell_chance` / `density` are literally your server's ore faucet.** The design target: the ore density a player experiences while tunneling (everything they hit is a decoy) should feel like the density of vanilla ore seen on cave walls. Think about which economy you want before touching these two numbers.

**`salt` is not in the config, and must never be reset.** It lives in the DB `meta` table, generated randomly on first startup. Resetting the salt re-rolls every unexposed vein in the world.

## Bundled ores

Overworld: `coal` `iron` `copper` `gold` `redstone` `lapis` `diamond` `emerald`
Nether (`dimension: NETHER`): `nether_quartz` `nether_gold` `ancient_debris`

All `enabled: true`, `density: 1.0`.

## Adding a new ore

```yaml
ores:
  my_custom_ore:
    enabled: true
    materials:
      stone: EMERALD_ORE            # generated when the base is stone/netherrack
      deepslate: DEEPSLATE_EMERALD_ORE
    dimension: NORMAL
    y_min: -16
    y_max: 80
    preferred_y: 32                 # distribution peak
    y_weight_points:                # optional; remove for legacy triangular fallback
      - [-16, 0.0]
      - [32, 1.0]
      - [80, 0.0]
    density: 1.0
    vein_size_min: 1
    vein_size_max: 3                # exactly 1..3 blocks per accepted vein
    cell_chance: 0.02
```

Save, restart. Check `/kyo stats` for the ore count +1, then stand at the target height and run `/kyo preview 16` to sanity-check hit density.

## Verifying changes

```
/kyo sample volume 24      # stand at the target Y, check hit/scanned ratio
/kyo preview 16            # see actual hit coordinates and ore types
/kyo inspect <x> <y> <z>   # single point: epoch, dirty, vein-function result
```

These three are brute-force scans, radius clamped to 1..24, **admin-only** — don't put them in automation that runs repeatedly.
